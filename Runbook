Please update the input.txt file (in input folder) with your test data, whatever you want to test this code

just run command like below to execute code (python3 <scriptname> <number of customers u want> <inputfile.txt>
 python3 Pass_event 5 input.txt    (To get top5 customers with the highest Simple Lifetime Value from data given in input.txt)
 python3 Pass_event 10 input.txt    (To get top10 customers with the highest Simple Lifetime Value from data given in input.txt)

Once ran, You can check output in file output.txt file in output folder
For your convenience, Program prints output on the console as well

FYI,
I did not use any exotic/pre-built libraries. Hence i dont need need to build Docker container for this.The can run on
any stand-alone platform with python2 or python3

Basic exception handling is done.If you dont pass required params to,Pass_event.py will print appropriate error message

Customer who made more revenue to us (in terms of Order amount) all together out of all his/her visits will be topper. Number of visits he paid is not the primary factor

I used in-memory data storage such as Python dictinories, as said in problem statement
